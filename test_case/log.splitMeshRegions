Create time

Create mesh for time = 0

Creating single patch per inter-region interface.

Trying to match regions to existing cell zones.


Number of regions:5

Writing region per cell file (for manual decomposition) to "/home/wywlxy/openfoam_0120_eraseTun/openfoam/test_case/constant/cellToRegion"

Writing region per cell as volScalarField to "/home/wywlxy/openfoam_0120_eraseTun/openfoam/test_case/0/cellToRegion"
